# Physics Fall Time Calculator

This repository demonstrates a simple Python script that computes how long it takes for an object to fall a given distance under constant gravity.

## How to Run

1. Install Python (3.6+).  If you don't know how to do this, install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Install any requirements (none so far, but `argparse` is part of the standard library).
4. Run:

```bash
python fall_time.py --height 10.0
```
